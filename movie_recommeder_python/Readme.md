# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

I‚Äôm excited to share my latest project‚Äîa Content-Based Movie Recommendation System! I have built a system that suggests movies similar to the ones you love.
### `üîç Key Insights`:
- **Dataset:** I used the TMDB Movies Dataset, which contains movie details like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- **Data Preprocessing:** I applied tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal to clean and standardize text data.
- **Feature Engineering:** I combined multiple text-based features to create a "tags" column for each movie.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization:** I converted text data into numerical form to identify important words.
- **Cosine Similarity:** I measured the closeness of movies based on their textual representations.
- **Gradio UI:** I developed an interactive web interface using Gradio, making the system user-friendly, allowing users to enter a movie title and instantly receive recommendations.

*Note*: My Gradio app is not publicly available, but for illustration purposes, I have attached an image showcasing how the system works!

### `üí° Inspiration`:
This idea came to my mind after reading an insightful article on GeeksforGeeks about Recommender Systems. The article provided a solid foundation on different recommendation techniques, which motivated me to explore and build this project.
