# Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio!

In this repository, you'll find a collection of my data analysis projects that showcase my skills, creativity, and passion for unraveling the mysteries hidden within datasets. From Python to SQL, to Excel, to Power BI, to SAS Enterprise Guide, I leverage diverse tools to extract meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.
Each project is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning. 
I deployed an ML model on Heroku using Flask, and it is now available to anyone. You can access it from my ML_model_deployment folder, where you'll find the link to the website in a text file named "MyProject".
I live by this quote: "Data is the new oil. Let's refine it into insights."
