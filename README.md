Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio!

In this repository, you'll find a collection of my data analysis projects that showcase my skills, creativity, and passion for unraveling the mysteries hidden within datasets. From Python to SQL, to Excel, to Power BI, to SAS Enterprise Guide, I leverage diverse tools to extract meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.
Each project is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning. 
I live by this quote: "Data is the new oil. Let's refine it into insights."
